# Contest app for FB group Turistika na Slovensku

This is my second Laravel project. At this moment without JavaScript (except partials->flash messages).   
I know, there can be few fails in code or git, but I am still learning it.   
I am trying to have clean and clear code ( with using repository directory, services directory, comments in code, etc)  
My English language is not the best, because I am using it after a long time, so sorry :D But I am working on it too.
